At GeoFront we work with you on your data cantered decision making. We walk you through the Journey of using data in decision making processes? Here is an proven approach we have used to allow organizations make use of data;

1. Decide on your strategy
2. Identify key areas and target data
3. Collect the data
4. Analyse the data
5. Make a decision about the data
6. Present your findings

Now, let’s dive a bit deeper into each of these steps!

## Step 1: GeoFront Strategy

At GeoFront, we believe that the best way to incorporate data into your decision-making process is to start with a clear strategy. Our first step is to identify what our organization wants to achieve and what business areas we want to improve. By creating a solid action plan, we can focus on gathering the right data to achieve our goals. For instance, if our goal is to enhance our services by improving response speed to our customers, we will start looking for relevant information.

## Step 2: Identify Key Areas and Target Data

The next step is to identify the key questions we want to answer about our customers and our services. We may want to know the average number of customers calling in each day, the busiest and slowest days, the number of customer service representatives scheduled at any given time, and how long each of them spends on a call or email. We may also want to analyze other data points, such as length of employment or department. By knowing what data we need, we can make informed decisions.

## Step 3: Collecting the Data

At GeoFront, we gather data from both internal and external sources. We reach out to data owners and harvesters to request the relevant data we need. For example, if we need to see all data on product sales for the last quarter, we will reach out to the finance department. Similarly, if we want to understand our organization’s turnover, we will contact HRIS. In some cases, we may purchase data, such as customers’ personal information, industry data, or other relevant data. We ensure that the data we collect aligns with our strategy and will help us make educated decisions.

## Step 4: Analysing the Data

Once we have collected the data, we analyse it to identify trends and insights that align with our strategy. We may use computerized platforms to help us sift through large volumes of data. During this step, we may need to clean the data by removing irrelevant data points. It is crucial to ensure that our conclusions are accurate and insightful.

## Step 5: Decision Making

At GeoFront, we make decisions based on the information we have gathered and analysed. However, we remain cautious of biases and other factors that may affect our decision-making process. We avoid confirmation bias and ensure that our decisions align with our strategy.

## Step 6: Presenting Your Findings

At the end of the process, we present our findings to relevant stakeholders, who are interested in our data analysis. We explain what the data is telling us, how we came to our conclusions, and how it will affect our strategy moving forward. We ensure that our data-based conclusion leads to action.
